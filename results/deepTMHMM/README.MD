This folder contains the DeepTMHMM results for S Cerevisiae, S Pombe, and Candida Albicans.

Each organism subfolder contains:
 - deeptmhmm_results.md: A markdown file with the counts of protein types and region types found in the entire proteome.
 - predicted_topologies.3line: A 3-line file containing each protein, its sequence on one line, and predicted topology on the next line.
 - TMRs.gff3: A GFF3 file containing the predicted transmembrane/SP regions and their start and end positions.
