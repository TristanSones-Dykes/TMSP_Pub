# figures

This directory contains figures generated and the additional synthesised data used to generate those figures.

Specifically, `SC_first_60.csv` contains predicted regions from the first 60 amino acids of S. Cerevisiae using Phobius, along with their hydrophobicity scores from Kyte-Doolittle and Rose scales. `SC_code_sheet.MD` is a code sheet describing its contents and origin.
